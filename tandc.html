                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">14. MODIFICATIONS TO THE SITE</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">7D Trade reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site or any features or portions thereof without prior notice.

                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">15. APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">This is an agreement to state that 7D Trade is not accountable for any dispute that shall take place in a country where cryptocurrency is illegal.

                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">16. ARBITRATION</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH 7D Trade AND IT LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.</p>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">You and 7D Trade agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Site, except that you and 7D Trade are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and 7D Trade agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in Thailand and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS. You and 7D Trade also agree that the Thailand federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if 7D Trade is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.

                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">17. SURVIVAL</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">Sections 5 (User Content), 7 (Trademarks), 9 (Third Party Content) ,10 (Feedback), 11 (Indemnification), 12 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 13 (Limitation on Liability), 15 (Applicable Law and Venue), 16 (Arbitration), this Section 17 (Survival) and Section 18 (Severability) will survive any termination or expiration of these Terms.</p>

                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">18. SEVERABILITY</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">If any provision of these Terms is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

                                  <h4 style="text-align: left;">19. Taxes</h4>
                                  <p style="text-align: justify">Any taxes imposed by the state and/or country in which the user resides will be borne by the user. The user will be responsible for settling any income tax owed to them, which will vary based on their state and nation. 7D Trade will not take notice of any matter regarding taxation towards the user. Taxes are not deducted from the total profits. The tax will be a taxable fee imposed on the user in accordance with the laws of each state and country.</p>
